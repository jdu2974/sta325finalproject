## EDA

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 7.5, fig.width = 16}
p1 <- ggplot(data = weather_train %>% filter(!is.na(EstimatedCondition)), aes(x = EstimatedCondition, y= Temperature)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Condition")


p1 + plot_annotation(title = 'Distribution of Temperature Based on Weather Condition', theme = theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 30)))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
